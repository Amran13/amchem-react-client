                "Flavophospholipol inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by interfering with murein (peptidoglycan) biosynthesis. The molecule mimics the natural substrate of the glycosyltransferase/transglycosylase enzymes of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), thereby blocking elongation of murein polysaccharide chains.\n\nInhibition of murein synthesis weakens the bacterial cell wall, leading to osmotic lysis. Animal cells are unaffected as they lack murein-containing structures. The antimicrobial activity of flavophospholipol is directed primarily against Gram-positive bacteria of economic importance present in the gastrointestinal tract, including species of Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Clostridium perfringens, and Enterococcus faecalis. The compound shows limited activity against certain Gram-negative organisms such as Pasteurella and Brucella species. Importantly, flavophospholipol does not significantly affect beneficial intestinal bacteria, particularly Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species, thereby allowing early establishment and maintenance of a healthy gut microflora."

                "Bacitracin methylene disalicylate is a cyclic polypeptide antibiotic that inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by blocking the dephosphorylation of C55-isoprenyl pyrophosphate, also known as bactoprenol pyrophosphate. This lipid carrier molecule is essential for the transport of peptidoglycan precursors across the bacterial cell membrane. Inhibition of this process prevents proper cell wall formation, leading to bacterial growth suppression and cell death. The methylene disalicylate component enhances the stability of bacitracin and contributes additional anti-inflammatory effects through modulation of prostaglandin synthesis, thereby supporting intestinal integrity and reducing inflammatory responses.\n\nThe antimicrobial activity of bacitracin methylene disalicylate is directed predominantly against Gram-positive bacteria of economic importance in animal production. These include Clostridium species, Streptococcus suis, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus species, Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, as well as certain actinomycetes and spirillae. Activity against Gram-negative organisms is limited. The compound exhibits minimal impact on beneficial intestinal microflora, allowing maintenance of a stable gut ecosystem while pathogenic bacteria remain susceptible even after decades of use."

                "Lincomycin exerts its antibacterial effect by binding to the 23S ribosomal RNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit at the peptidyl transferase center. This binding inhibits peptide bond formation and blocks elongation of the growing protein chain, thereby suppressing bacterial protein synthesis. At therapeutic concentrations, the effect is primarily bacteriostatic, while bactericidal activity may occur at higher concentrations depending on the susceptibility of the organism and bacterial load. This mode of action explains its effectiveness in controlling enteric and systemic infections as well as its performance-enhancing effects in food-producing animals.\n\nLincomycin shows excellent activity against Gram-positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus species, Streptococcus species, Clostridium perfringens, and Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae. It is also highly active against Mycoplasma species. In addition, lincomycin demonstrates activity against certain Gram-negative and anaerobic organisms of clinical relevance in livestock, including Lawsonia intracellularis and Brachyspira hyodysenteriae. Beneficial intestinal microflora such as Lactobacillus species are minimally affected at recommended inclusion levels."

              content:
                "Nosiheptide exerts its antibacterial effect by selectively binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible bacteria. It interferes with the function of elongation factor EF-G, thereby blocking ribosomal translocation during the elongation phase of protein synthesis. At low concentrations, nosiheptide inhibits bacterial growth, while at higher concentrations it exhibits bactericidal activity. By suppressing pathogenic bacteria in the intestinal tract, the product helps maintain a stable gut environment, reduces intestinal inflammation, and supports normal digestive and absorptive functions.\n\nNosiheptide demonstrates potent activity against Gram-positive bacteria, including Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium species, Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), Streptococcus species, and Mycoplasma species. Its strong efficacy against Clostridium perfringens makes it particularly effective for the prevention of necrotic enteritis and other Clostridium-associated intestinal disorders."

                "Following oral administration through feed, nosiheptide is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Its activity is therefore localized within the intestinal lumen, where it selectively modulates gut microbiota without producing systemic exposure. The compound is excreted unchanged in the feces, and no tissue accumulation or residues are observed when used as directed. This pharmacokinetic profile contributes to its favorable safety margin and zero withdrawal period for meat.\n\nStudies have demonstrated that nosiheptide binds to a unique ribosomal site, resulting in minimal cross-resistance with other antibiotic classes. Experimental data show significant improvements in intestinal morphology, including increased villus height, improved villus-to-crypt depth ratio, and enhanced goblet cell density. Nosiheptide has also been shown to reduce intestinal inflammatory markers and upregulate tight junction proteins such as claudin-1, occludin, and ZO-1, thereby strengthening intestinal barrier integrity and improving nutrient absorption efficiency."

It interferes with the initiation and elongation phases of protein synthesis by inhibiting the formation of functional ribosomal complexes and preventing peptide bond formation. Through this mechanism, avilamycin suppresses the growth of susceptible bacteria and reduces intestinal pathogen load. In addition to its direct antibacterial action, avilamycin improves metabolic efficiency by inducing a glucose-sparing effect, reducing lactate production, increasing volatile fatty acid production and absorption in the lower gut, and enhancing nitrogen retention, thereby producing a protein-sparing effect.\n\nAvilamycin exhibits excellent bactericidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria, including Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, Streptococcus species, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus species. Its strong activity against Clostridium perfringens makes it particularly effective in the prevention and control of necrotic enteritis in poultry and necrotizing enteritis in swine.

                "Virginiamycin exerts its antibacterial effect through the combined and synergistic action of two components, factors M1 and S1. Factor M1 binds to the peptidyl transferase center of the 50S ribosomal subunit, while factor S1 binds to a different ribosomal site, inducing conformational changes. Together, these actions result in irreversible inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis and bactericidal activity. By suppressing pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria in the intestinal tract, virginiamycin reduces toxin production, stabilizes gut microbiota, and improves nutrient utilization.\n\nVirginiamycin is highly active against Gram-positive bacteria, including Clostridium perfringens, Streptococcus species, Staphylococcus aureus (including some resistant strains), and Enterococcus species. Its activity against Clostridium perfringens makes it particularly effective for prevention and control of necrotic enteritis in poultry and Clostridium-associated enteric disorders in swine. Activity against Gram-negative bacteria is limited."

Any absorbed fraction is rapidly eliminated, leading to minimal systemic exposure. When used according to recommended withdrawal periods, no significant tissue residues are observed, supporting its suitability for use in food-producing animals under regulated conditions.\n\nScientific studies have demonstrated that virginiamycin significantly reduces the incidence and severity of necrotic enteritis by controlling the proliferation and toxin production of Clostridium perfringens. Supplementation has been associated with improved intestinal integrity, reduced expression of inflammatory cytokines, and enhanced expression of nutrient transporter genes. These effects translate into improved feed efficiency, increased weight gain, better carcass quality in swine, and improved survival and uniformity in poultry flocks."

It contains tylvalosin, a semi-synthetic macrolide antibiotic derived from tylosin, specifically developed for veterinary use. The product is intended for the treatment and control of respiratory and enteric infections in swine and poultry caused by tylvalosin-sensitive organisms. Due to its enhanced pharmacokinetic profile compared with older macrolides, tylvalosin provides improved tissue penetration and sustained therapeutic concentrations at sites of infection."

                "Tylvalosin is a semi-synthetic macrolide antibiotic that inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit, thereby blocking peptide chain translocation and suppressing bacterial growth. Compared with tylosin, tylvalosin demonstrates superior tissue distribution, longer persistence in target organs, and enhanced activity against certain macrolide-resistant strains.\n\nThe antibacterial spectrum includes strong activity against Mycoplasma species, particularly Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, Mycoplasma gallisepticum, and Mycoplasma synoviae, as well as Lawsonia intracellularis and Brachyspira species. It also exhibits activity against numerous Gram-positive organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus (including penicillin-resistant strains), Streptococcus species, Erysipelothrix suis, Listeria species, and certain Clostridium species. Gram-negative bacteria are generally less susceptible."

High concentrations are achieved in lung tissue, intestinal mucosa, and inflammatory exudates, ensuring optimal efficacy at primary sites of infection. Tissue concentrations persist longer than serum levels, contributing to sustained antimicrobial activity. The drug is primarily metabolized in the liver and excreted via bile and urine.\n\nExperimental and field studies demonstrate that tylvalosin significantly reduces pulmonary lesions associated with enzootic pneumonia in swine and decreases intestinal inflammation in animals affected by proliferative enteropathy. Its ability to maintain high concentrations in lung and intestinal tissues supports superior clinical outcomes in respiratory and enteric disease complexes compared with older macrolide antibiotics."

This prevents larvae from developing normally into pupae and adult flies, thereby breaking the fly life cycle at the manure level.\n\nCyromazine has no antibacterial activity and does not affect intestinal microflora. After ingestion, it passes through the digestive tract largely unchanged and is excreted in the feces at concentrations sufficient to inhibit larval development in manure.\n\nAMCHEM CYRO-MIX® 1% PREMIX is effective against a wide range of nuisance fly species that breed in poultry manure, including Musca domestica (house fly), Fannia canicularis (lesser house fly), Muscina stabulans (false stable fly), and Hermetia illucens (American soldier fly). The product does not kill adult flies; therefore, reduction in adult fly populations occurs gradually as larval development is suppressed."

                "Diclazuril acts by disrupting mitochondrial respiration in coccidia through inhibition of the electron transport chain, leading to depletion of energy and inhibition of parasite development, particularly at asexual and sexual stages. Maduramicin, a polyether ionophore, disrupts sodium and potassium ion transport across the parasite cell membrane, causing osmotic imbalance and parasite death. The complementary mechanisms result in synergistic anticoccidial activity and enhanced efficacy against resistant Eimeria strains.\n\nAMCHEM DICLAMYCIN® PREMIX is active against all major pathogenic Eimeria species affecting broiler chickens, including E. tenella, E. acervulina, E. necatrix, E. maxima, E. brunetti, and E. mitis.

                "AMVIT-C STABLE® is classified as a vitamin supplement. Vitamin C is an essential water-soluble vitamin with broad physiological functions. It acts as a potent antioxidant by donating electrons and scavenging free radicals, thereby protecting cells from oxidative damage. Vitamin C is a critical cofactor for prolyl and lysyl hydroxylase enzymes involved in collagen synthesis, supporting bone strength, vascular integrity, skin health, and eggshell quality.\n\nVitamin C also plays an important role in immune function by enhancing leukocyte activity, supporting antibody production, and modulating inflammatory responses. It contributes to stress adaptation by supporting adrenal cortex function and regulating cortisol secretion. Additionally, vitamin C enhances iron absorption by reducing ferric iron to the more bioavailable ferrous form. The L-ascorbate 2-monophosphate form is enzymatically cleaved in vivo, releasing active ascorbic acid at the tissue level."

                "After oral administration, L-ascorbate 2-monophosphate is absorbed in the small intestine and hydrolyzed to free ascorbic acid. Vitamin C is widely distributed to body tissues, particularly those with high metabolic activity. Excess amounts are rapidly excreted via urine, and no tissue accumulation occurs, supporting a wide margin of safety.\n\nResearch published in Nature and related journals demonstrates that L-ascorbate 2-monophosphate retains 85–95% potency after feed pelleting at temperatures up to 90 °C and during extended storage, compared with only 20–40% retention for conventional ascorbic acid. Multiple studies show that vitamin C supplementation during periods of stress—such as heat stress, disease challenge, vaccination, transport, and weaning—significantly improves immune response, reduces cortisol levels, and helps maintain growth and production performance. In poultry, supplementation improves eggshell quality, reduces stress-related production drops, and enhances heat tolerance. In swine, vitamin C reduces weaning stress, improves growth performance, and supports carcass quality. In aquaculture species, dietary vitamin C is essential due to the inability of fish and shrimp to synthesize it endogenously."

                "AMCHEM TRACE MIN® is classified as a nutritional supplement providing inorganic trace mineral salts. Its activity is based on supplying essential minerals in forms that dissociate in the gastrointestinal tract to release bioavailable ions required for physiological processes.\n\nFollowing ingestion, inorganic mineral salts dissolve under gastric and intestinal conditions, allowing absorption primarily through passive diffusion and specific mineral transport mechanisms. Although their bioavailability is generally lower than that of organic or chelated forms due to interactions with phytate, fiber, and other dietary antagonists, inorganic trace minerals remain cost-effective and widely used when diets are properly formulated.\n\nIron supports oxygen transport and cellular energy metabolism; zinc is essential for protein synthesis, immune competence, and epithelial integrity; copper participates in iron utilization, connective tissue formation, and antioxidant enzyme systems; manganese is required for skeletal development, metabolism, and reproductive function; iodine regulates thyroid hormone synthesis and metabolic rate; selenium functions as a component of antioxidant enzymes and immune defense; and cobalt is essential for vitamin B₁₂ synthesis in ruminants. Together, these minerals sustain normal physiological, productive, and reproductive performance."

Monocalcium phosphate dissociates efficiently in the gastrointestinal tract, releasing phosphate ions that are readily absorbed and utilized for metabolic and structural functions.\n\nThe relatively high phosphorus and lower calcium content of MCP allows nutritionists to meet phosphorus requirements without oversupplying calcium. This is particularly important in high-producing layers, young animals with precise mineral needs, and diets containing multiple calcium sources. Adequate phosphorus supply supports skeletal mineralization, cellular energy transfer, nucleic acid synthesis, and normal metabolic regulation."

Utilization is influenced by dietary Ca:P ratio, vitamin D₃ status, age, and production stage. Absorbed minerals are incorporated into bone and other tissues, with excess excreted through normal regulatory mechanisms.\n\nNutritional studies demonstrate that monocalcium phosphate provides one of the highest phosphorus digestibility rates among inorganic phosphate sources, typically ranging from 80–90% in poultry and swine. Research confirms efficient incorporation of phosphorus from MCP into the bone mineral matrix, supporting skeletal strength and development. The use of MCP facilitates accurate mineral formulation and helps prevent disorders associated with phosphorus deficiency or mineral imbalance."

Its mode of action combines enzymatic degradation of mycotoxins with physical adsorption and gut health support.\n\nFollowing ingestion, Bacillus subtilis spores germinate in the gastrointestinal tract and produce a range of detoxifying enzymes, including lactonohydrolases and esterases. These enzymes cleave and modify the chemical structures of certain mycotoxins, particularly aflatoxin B₁ and zearalenone, converting them into less toxic metabolites that pose reduced risk to the animal. In addition to direct detoxification, Bacillus subtilis competes with toxigenic fungi for ecological niches, produces antimicrobial compounds that inhibit fungal growth, supports the establishment of beneficial gut microbiota, enhances intestinal barrier integrity, and modulates immune responses.\n\nYeast cell wall components provide complementary mycotoxin binding capacity for toxins that escape enzymatic degradation, while montmorillonite contributes strong adsorption of aflatoxins through electrostatic interactions. The combined biological and adsorptive mechanisms result in effective, broad-spectrum mycotoxin control without compromising nutrient availability."

Its mode of action integrates physical adsorption of mycotoxins, suppression of fungal growth, and support of intestinal and immune function.\n\nMontmorillonite provides high-affinity binding of polar mycotoxins, particularly aflatoxins and trichothecenes, through electrostatic interactions and surface adsorption. Yeast cell wall components, including mannan-oligosaccharides and β-glucans, contribute additional binding capacity for a broader range of mycotoxins while also supporting gut health and immune responsiveness. Organic acids such as propionic, acetic, and formic acid inhibit the growth of molds and pathogenic microorganisms in feed, thereby reducing further mycotoxin production at the source. Silica improves flow characteristics and enhances the overall adsorption surface area of the formulation.\n\nThe combined mechanisms provide protection against existing mycotoxin contamination and help prevent new toxin formation, resulting in improved animal health and feed utilization."

                "AMCHEM TOXIN BINDER® is classified as a mycotoxin adsorbent. Its activity is based on the strong adsorption properties of aluminosilicate clay minerals with a layered structure and extensive surface area. The negatively charged surfaces of HSCAS and bentonite attract and bind positively charged regions of mycotoxins, particularly aflatoxins, through electrostatic interactions and physical entrapment within the clay matrix. Once bound, the mycotoxin–clay complex remains stable throughout the gastrointestinal tract and prevents intestinal absorption of the toxins. The bound toxins are subsequently excreted via feces without being released back into the digestive system.\n\nThe inclusion of yeast cell wall components provides supplementary binding support for additional mycotoxin classes and contributes to overall gut health. By reducing the toxic load entering systemic circulation, AMCHEM TOXIN BINDER® helps protect liver function, immune competence, and productive performance."

Its activity is derived from the synergistic functions of mannan-oligosaccharides and β-glucans present in yeast cell walls. Mannan-oligosaccharides bind pathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Proteus, and Klebsiella that express mannose-specific lectins on their surface. By binding these pathogens, MOS prevents their attachment and colonization in the intestinal tract, facilitating their removal through normal digestive processes. This reduction in pathogen load supports intestinal integrity and lowers the incidence of enteric infections.\n\nβ-glucans act primarily as modulators of the innate immune system. They activate immune cells such as macrophages, neutrophils, and natural killer cells through pattern-recognition receptors including Dectin-1 and complement receptor-3. "

In its undissociated form, propionic acid penetrates fungal cell membranes and dissociates within the cytoplasm, leading to acidification of intracellular contents. This process disrupts metabolic enzymes and essential cellular functions, resulting in inhibition of spore germination and suppression of mycelial growth.\n\nThe antifungal efficacy of propionic acid is pH-dependent and is enhanced under slightly acidic conditions, where a higher proportion of the acid remains in its undissociated form. Through these mechanisms, AMCHEM ANTIMOLD® effectively inhibits the growth of common storage fungi and reduces the risk of mycotoxin formation in feed."

                "AMCHEM ACID® is classified as a feed acidifier and antimicrobial agent. Its primary mode of action is based on the antimicrobial activity of formic acid. In its undissociated form, formic acid penetrates bacterial cell membranes and dissociates inside the cytoplasm, leading to a reduction in intracellular pH. This disrupts essential metabolic enzymes, interferes with DNA synthesis, and inhibits bacterial growth, with particular effectiveness against gram-negative pathogens such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella species.\n\nIn addition to its antimicrobial effects, AMCHEM ACID® enhances digestive efficiency by lowering gastric pH, thereby increasing pepsin activity and improving protein digestion and amino acid absorption. Feed acidification also reduces buffering capacity of the diet, supports the growth of beneficial lactic acid–producing bacteria, and contributes to a more stable intestinal environment.\n\nFormic acid further improves mineral availability by maintaining minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, zinc, and iron in soluble form, preventing precipitation in the small intestine and enhancing absorption."

                "AMCHEM ALLICIN® is classified as a phytogenic feed additive and natural AGP alternative. Its activity is primarily attributed to allicin-derived organosulfur compounds, including diallyl disulfide and diallyl trisulfide. These compounds exert broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity by disrupting bacterial cell membranes, inhibiting sulfhydryl-dependent enzymes, and interfering with essential metabolic pathways. This results in effective suppression of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., and Clostridium spp. In addition, the antioxidant properties of organosulfur compounds help neutralize free radicals and enhance endogenous antioxidant defense systems, including glutathione and superoxide dismutase.\n\nAMCHEM ALLICIN® also modulates immune function by enhancing phagocytic activity, cytokine production, and natural killer cell responses. By positively influencing intestinal microbiota composition, the product supports beneficial bacteria, improves digestive enzyme activity, enhances nutrient absorption, and contributes to improved growth performance and feed efficiency without the risk of antimicrobial resistance."

No tissue accumulation or residue formation is expected when used at recommended inclusion levels.\n\nAnimal nutrition studies demonstrate that dietary supplementation with garlic-derived allicin improves growth rate, feed conversion efficiency, and immune responses in poultry and swine. Research confirms effective antimicrobial action without promoting bacterial resistance, highlighting its value as a sustainable alternative to conventional antibiotic growth promoters. Additional studies show enhanced antioxidant status and improved gut health under production and environmental stress conditions."

                "AMCHEM TRIBUTYRIN® is classified as a short-chain fatty acid–based feed additive and AGP alternative. Tributyrin is a triglyceride of butyric acid that remains stable during feed processing and storage. After ingestion, digestive lipases hydrolyze tributyrin, gradually releasing butyric acid along the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nButyric acid serves as the primary energy source for colonocytes, supporting intestinal epithelial renewal and integrity. It modulates gene expression through inhibition of histone deacetylases, influencing pathways related to inflammation, cell differentiation, and apoptosis. Butyrate enhances tight-junction protein expression, thereby strengthening the intestinal barrier and reducing gut permeability. It also exhibits anti-inflammatory effects by down-regulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and contributes to antimicrobial action by disrupting pathogenic bacterial membranes and favorably modulating gut microbiota. In addition, butyrate supports immune regulation by enhancing regulatory T-cell function, leading to improved resilience against enteric challenges."

Research shows that tributyrin supplementation delivers comparable or superior growth promotion effects to conventional antibiotic growth promoters, particularly in broilers and post-weaning piglets during periods of enteric stress or challenge."

                "AMCHEM MONOLAURIN® is classified as a medium-chain monoglyceride and natural antimicrobial feed additive. Its activity is based on the unique physical mode of action of alpha-monolaurin on microbial cell membranes.\n\nAlpha-monolaurin integrates into the lipid bilayers of pathogenic microorganisms, particularly gram-positive bacteria, disrupting membrane integrity and causing leakage of cellular contents. This results in rapid bacterial inactivation without reliance on specific metabolic targets, thereby minimizing the risk of antimicrobial resistance. Alpha-monolaurin also disrupts lipid envelopes of enveloped viruses, reducing viral infectivity.\n\nIn addition, alpha-monolaurin interferes with bacterial quorum sensing mechanisms, limiting the expression of virulence factors and toxin production. Its selective action allows beneficial gut microbiota such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species to be preserved, supporting a balanced intestinal ecosystem. Upon hydrolysis, released lauric acid is rapidly absorbed and utilized as an energy source by intestinal cells, further supporting gut integrity and function."

                "AMCHEM FLAVOUR® is a range of feed flavoring additives supplied in powdered or liquid form, depending on formulation, with a characteristic and stable flavor profile. The product is designed to improve the sensory properties of feed by enhancing aroma and taste, thereby increasing voluntary feed intake. Different flavor options are available to suit specific species, age groups, and production stages, as well as to improve acceptance of medicated or reformulated diets."

              content:
                "AMCHEM FLAVOUR® is classified as a feed palatability enhancer. Its activity is based on stimulation of olfactory and gustatory receptors, which increases feed attractiveness and promotes consistent intake. By masking bitter or otherwise unpalatable ingredients such as medications, minerals, or alternative raw materials, the product helps maintain normal feeding behavior during stress, dietary transitions, or health challenges. Repeated exposure to consistent flavors can also condition animals to feeds, supporting stable consumption patterns."

              content:
                "Feed flavoring agents act locally at the sensory level and are not intended for systemic absorption. The components are present at low inclusion levels and are metabolized or excreted through normal physiological pathways without accumulation in tissues.\n\nAnimal nutrition studies demonstrate that the use of feed flavoring agents improves feed intake when palatability is compromised due to medication inclusion, ingredient variability, or environmental stress. Research also shows that consistent flavor application can improve feeding behavior and reduce intake fluctuations during critical production phases such as weaning, transition diets, or disease recovery."
